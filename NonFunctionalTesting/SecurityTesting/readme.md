# Tools

Some tools include:

* **BDD Security.** A security testing automation framework. This uses a natural language syntax to describe security functions as features.
* **Microsoft Azure Advisor.** A configuration scanner that will identify whether cloud infrastructure tools are using the right software best practices.
* **Mittn.** An open source test automation framework, which is ideal for those accustomed to Python.
* **GauntIT.** A test automation framework, which is ideal for those accustomed to Ruby development.
* **Burp Intruder.** A commercial application and infrastructure scanner, which can be used to ensure applications are interacting properly with the environment.
* **OWASP Scanner.** An open source application and infrastructure scanner, similar to Burp Intruder.
* **Veracode.** Veracode is a Code Analysis tool that can be used to find vulnerabilities within your application structure.
Contrast Security. A runtime application security tool, Contrast Security will run inside of your application to identify any potential faults.

# Security Test Automation

The processes would be slightly varied from the original TDD process
* Perform a Static Security Scan on the code written
* Add a Test
* Run all tests and trigger Dynamic Security scan in the background
* See if the new one fails
* See if any security flaw identified on the newly developed code
* Write some code as per the security guidelines without affecting functional behavior
* Run tests and Refactor code
* Repeat

# Advantages of STDD over TDD
Along with the TDD advantages we would have some additional advantages using STDD process
* Much less debug time
* Code proven to meet requirements
* Tests become Safety Net
* Near zero defects
* Shorter development cycles
* Faster security certifications for the application
* Reduced Security Flaws


# Security Test Automation Tools 

Security Testing Tools

## SAST (Static Analysis)

As specified earlier we could use tools like Lint (Android), SonarCube (Java), Clang Static Analyzer (iOS) and Brakeman (Ruby).

## DAST (Dynamic Analysis)

Dynamic analysis needed to be run in background of your tests execution in the TDD process, which means we need a proxy enabled security tool which could be acting as a listener.

We could think about tools like OWASP ZAP/BURP which could do the monitoring as well enables their user to attack the application on the local development environment.
