Active Scan vs Passive Scan:

Passive scan rules look at traffic as it passes through ZAP (proxied, or spidered, optionally Fuzzed) without making any requests themselves.
Active scan rules run during Active scanning and do make requests by altering request parameters/details to elicit certain types of responses or behaviors.
