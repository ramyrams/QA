### Workflows
The third-level folders are for more complicated tests that span multiple API calls. 
For example, your API might have a checkout flow that involves separate calls to create an order from a shopping cart, enter the shipping address, select the shipment method, and submit the payment information. 
In this case, you‚Äôd create a ‚Äúworkflow‚Äù folder named something like ‚ÄúCheckout‚Äù that contains the three requests.
