According to Microsoft, the Core Performance Testing Activities are:

1. **Identify Test Environment** – where it is important to have the exact replica of the production environment
2. **Identify Performance Acceptance Criteria** – predefine the benchmarks of expected performance
3. **Plan and Design Tests** – Identification of user test scenarios based on their importance, frequency and performance impact
4. **Configure Test Environment** – setting up the test environment as in the first step
5. **Implement Test Design** – scripting user scenarios with the help of performance testing tools
6. **Execute Tests** – testing on scripted user scenarios against different user sets with different configurations
7. **Analyze, Report and Retest** – Analyze test results with benchmarks, report results to stakeholders and Re-test if necessary


# PERFORMANCE TESTING PROCESS
* COLLECT
  * Assess Business Requirements
  * Review Application Features
  * Identify Key Elements to Setup Test Environment
* PLAN & STRATEGIZE
  * Identify Performance Test Matrices
  * Define Baseline Values
  * Define Timing, Tools & Types of Performance tests
  * Creation of Test Plans
* DEFINE & DESIGN
  * Creation of Test Scenarios
  * Define Test Data
  * Configure Testing Environment
* EXECUTE
  * Execute Test Scenarios
  * Validate Results
  * Record Outcomes
* DELIVER
  * Analyze Results
  * Make Recommendations
  
  
# Services Offered

Our offers load/stress testing services to identify below:
* Identify Performance leaks in the application by doing a performance testing on the applications
* Identify Key areas where performance need to be improved

Our Load Testing model has 3 stages as described below

# Stage 1 – Test Planning Phase

The following activities will be carried out as part of the Test Planning phase:
* Identify performance goals and objectives
* Identify the SLA’s for performance testing
* Define phases for performance testing
* Define Infrastructure
* Identify Load Models
* Identify Volumetrics (Load Mix)
* Identify project support requirements
* Determine the Acceptable test Conditions
* Identify Performance Metrics
* Identify Risks
* Create Performance Test Plan
 

# Stage 2 – Test Preparation Phase
The following activities will be carried out as part of the Test Preparation phase:

* Design Test Data Strategy
* Identify requirements for test data
* Identify Tools for Test data
* Test Environment Setup
* Test environment readiness check [Application deployment and configuration on the dedicated performance test environment ]
* Test Data preparation & pre-requisites validation check
* Test artifacts creation (automated test scripts preparation)
* Dry tests / Validation tests will be carried out for go-ahead on actual tests
 

# Stage 3 – Test Execution and Reporting Phase
The following activities will be carried out as part of the Test Preparation phase:
* Create Performance Test Scenarios
* Execute Environment shakeout
* Execute Baseline/Benchmark tests
* Execute the performance tests
* Analyze test results
* Create Performance test execution report
* Create Performance Test summary repor twith possible recommendations for performance optimization
